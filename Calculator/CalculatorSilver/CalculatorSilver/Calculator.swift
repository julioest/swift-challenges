// I like this class. This could have been a struct but a class was the right call.
// A class is like a living organism in your program. I can imagine this being the
// brain and having features like: calculating longer equations where you'll probably
// need to store memory. I can see caching, history, etc being added. This is headed in
// the right direction. Whatever you do try your best to avoid making this a singleton.
